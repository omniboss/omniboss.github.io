# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
To be used for classes by The Tech Academy.

On my journey to become a software developer, I will be learning the basics of HTML and CSS to creat websites. I will use this repository to store my projects.

This is my final webiste assignment for my HTML and CSS class. I utilized HTML to create the skeleton of my website and used CSS to add style and beauty to my page including a table with background color and transparency, a background video, and hover effects.
